abstract = {Summary.  We analyse decisions to reopen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina made by business establishments on major business thoroughfares in New Orleans by using a spatial probit methodology. Our approach allows for interdependence between decisions to reopen by one establishment and those of its neighbours. There is a large literature on the role that is played by spatial dependence in firm location decisions, and we find evidence of strong dependence in decisions by firms to reopen in the aftermath of a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina. This interdependence has important statistical implications for how we analyse business recovery after disasters, as well as government aid programmes.}

  abstract	= {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability,
		  Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the
		  evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies
		  was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the
		  posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior
		  probability on the null is one-half. Although there has
		  been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the
		  context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been
		  given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied
		  statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses
		  of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific
		  applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and
		  psychology. We emphasize the following points: From
		  Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis
		  testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a
		  scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating
		  evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors
		  provide a way of incorporating external information into
		  the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes
		  factors are very general and do not require alternative
		  models to be nested. Several techniques are available for
		  computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic
		  approximations that are easy to compute using the output
		  from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In
		  "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or
		  BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the
		  Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require
		  evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested
		  in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted
		  to weights to be attached to various models so that a
		  composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes
		  account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have
		  been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into
		  account when the class of models initially considered is
		  very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an
		  evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and
		  feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the
		  prior distributions used.},

Abstract = {{For bivariate meta-analysis of diagnostic studies, likelihood approaches
   are very popular. However, they often run into numerical problems with
   possible non-convergence. In addition, the construction of confidence
   intervals is controversial. Bayesian methods based on Markov chain Monte
   Carlo (MCMC) sampling could be used, but are often difficult to
   implement, and require long running times and diagnostic convergence
   checks. Recently, a new Bayesian deterministic inference approach for
   latent Gaussian models using integrated nested Laplace approximations
   (INLA) has been proposed. With this approach MCMC sampling becomes
   redundant as the posterior marginal distributions are directly and
   accurately approximated. By means of a real data set we investigate the
   influence of the prior information provided and compare the results
   obtained by INLA, MCMC, and the maximum likelihood procedure SAS PROC
   NLMIXED. Using a simulation study we further extend the comparison of
   INLA and SAS PROC NLMIXED by assessing their performance in terms of
   bias, mean-squared error, coverage probability, and convergence rate.
   The results indicate that INLA is more stable and gives generally better
   coverage probabilities for the pooled estimates and less biased
   estimates of variance parameters. The user-friendliness of INLA is
   demonstrated by documented R-code. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Latent Gaussian models are a common construct in statistical
   applications where a latent Gaussian field, indirectly observed through

   Cross-validatory checks are usually preferred because posterior

Abstract = {{Many commonly used models in statistics can be formulated as (Bayesian)
   hierarchical Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) models. These are
   characterised by assuming a (often large) GMRF as the second stage in
   the hierarchical structure and a few hyperparameters at the third stage.
   Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the common approach for Bayesian
   inference in such models. The variance of the Monte Carlo estimates is
   O-p(M-1/2) where M is the number of samples in the chain so, in order to
   obtain precise estimates of marginal densities, say, we need M to be
   very large. Inspired by the fact that often one-block and independence
   samplers can be constructed for hierarchical GMRF-models, we will in
   this work investigate whether MCMC is really needed to estimate marginal
   densities, which often is the goal of the analysis. By making use of
   GMRF-approximations, we show by typical examples that marginal densities
   can indeed be very precisely estimated by deterministic schemes. The
   methodological and practical consequence of these findings are indeed
   positive. We conjecture that for many hierarchical GMRF-models there is
   really no need for MCMC based inference to estimate marginal densities.
   Further, by making use of numerical methods for sparse matrices the
   computational costs of these deterministic schemes are nearly instant
   compared to the MCMC alternative. In particular, we discuss in detail
   the issue of computing marginal variances for GMRFs. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Spatial generalized linear mixed models are common in applied
   statistics. Most users are satisfied using a Gaussian distribution for
   the spatial latent variables in this model, but it is unclear whether
   the Gaussian assumption holds. Wrong Gaussian assumptions cause bias in
   the parameter estimates and affect the accuracy of spatial predictions.
   Thus, there is a need for more flexible priors for the latent variables,
   and to perform efficient inference and spatial prediction in the
   resulting models. In this paper we use a skew normal prior distribution
   for the spatial latent variables. We propose new approximate Bayesian
   methods for the inference and spatial prediction in this model. A key
   ingredient in our approximations is using the closed skew normal
   distribution to approximate the full conditional for the latent
   variables. Our approximate inference and spatial prediction methods are
   fast and deterministic, using no sampling based strategies. The results
   indicate that the skew normal prior model can give better predictions

Abstract = {{Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used in disease mapping as they
   provide a natural framework for modeling spatial correlations. Their
   challenges, however, lie in computational burden and memory
   requirements. In disease mapping models, the other difficulty is
   inference, which is analytically intractable due to the non-Gaussian
   observation model. In this paper, we address both these challenges. We
   show how to efficiently build fully and partially independent
   conditional (FIC/PIC) sparse approximations for the GP in
   two-dimensional surface, and how to conduct approximate inference using
   expectation propagation (EP) algorithm and Laplace approximation (LA).
   We also propose to combine FIC with a compactly supported covariance
   function to construct a computationally efficient additive model that
   can model long and short length-scale spatial correlations
   simultaneously. The benefit of these approximations is computational.
   The sparse GPs speed up the computations and reduce the memory
   requirements. The posterior inference via EP and Laplace approximation
   is much faster and is practically as accurate as via Markov chain Monte
   Carlo. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   consider the common geostatistical case with a high dimensional latent

   methods of inference are deterministic, using no simulation-based
   inference. The first proposed approximation is fast to compute and is
   `practically sufficient', meaning that results do not show any bias or
   dispersion effects that might affect decision making. Our second
   approximation, an improvement of the first version, is `practically
   exact', meaning that one would have to run MCMC simulations for very
   much longer than is typically done to detect any indication of error in
   the approximate results. For small-count data the approximations are
   slightly worse, but still very accurate. Our methods are limited to
   likelihood functions that give unimodal full conditionals for the latent
   variable. The methods help to expand the future scope of non-Gaussian

   model the log intensity semiparametrically using an adaptive version of
   Gaussian Markov random fields to smooth the corresponding counts. The
   inference is carried by an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation
   algorithm. Compared to existing methods for intensity estimation, for
   example, parametric modeling and kernel smoothing, the proposed
   estimator not only provides inference regarding the dependence of the
   intensity function on possible covariates, but also uses information
   from the data to adaptively determine the amount of smoothing at the
   local level. The effectiveness of using our method is demonstrated
   through simulation studies and an application to a rainforest dataset.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of animal movement and resource use has become a standard
   tool in the study of animal ecology. Telemetry devices have become quite
   sophisticated in terms of overall size and data collecting capacity.
   Statistical methods to analyze movement have responded, becoming ever
   more complex, often relying on state-space modeling. Estimation of
   movement metrics such as utilization distributions have not followed
   suit, relying primarily on kernel density estimation. Here we consider a
   method for making inference about space use that is free of all of the
   major problems associated with kernel density estimation of utilization
   distributions such as autocorrelation, irregular time gaps, and error in
   observed locations. Our proposed method is based on a data augmentation
   approach that defines use as a summary of the complete path of the
   animal which is only partially observed. We use a sample from the
   posterior distribution of the complete path to construct a posterior
   sample for the metric of interest. Three basic importance sampling based
   methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of the path are
   proposed and compared. We demonstrate the augmentation approach by
   estimating a spatial map of diving intensity for female northern fur
   seals in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska.}},

Abstract = {{Infant mortality is considered a sensitive health indicator, and
   knowledge of its geographical profile is essential for formulating
   appropriate public health policies. Disease mapping aims to describe the
   geographical distribution of disease incidence and mortality rates. Due
   to the heavy instability of crude rates in small areas, methods
   involving Bayesian smoothing of rates are used, drawing on information
   for the whole area or neighborhood to estimate the event rate. The
   current study compares empirical Bayesian (EB) and fully Bayesian (FB)
   methods for infant mortality rates (accumulated data from 2001 to 2004)
   in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. This study highlights the advantages
   of Bayesian estimators for viewing and interpreting maps. For the
   problem at hand, EB and FB methods showed quite similar results and had
   the great advantage of easy use by health professionals, since they
   evenly highlight the main spatial patterns in the mortality rate in the

   variability was estimated on the basis of the sample size, the number of
   cases per spatial unit and time interval, and an adjacency matrix of the
   municipalities using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation technique to
   assess the spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of the

Abstract = {{Bluetongue (BT) is a vector-borne viral disease of ruminants. The
   infection is widespread globally with major implications for
   international animal trade and production. In 2006, BT virus serotype 8
   (BTV-8) was encountered in Europe for the first time, causing extensive
   production losses and death in susceptible livestock. Following the
   appearance of BTV-8 in Switzerland in 2007, a compulsory vaccination
   programme was launched in the subsequent year. Due to social factors and
   difficulties to reach animals on high pasture, the regional vaccination
   coverage varied across the country in both 2008 and 2009. In this study,
   the effect of vaccination on the spatial occurrence of BTV-8 and the
   associated relative disease risk in Switzerland in 2008 and 2009 were
   investigated by a spatial Bayesian hierarchical approach. Bayesian
   posterior distributions were obtained by integrated nested Laplace
   approximations, a promising alternative to commonly used Markov chain

Abstract = {{Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important
   ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The
   specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive
   interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs
   are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense
   matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today
   is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational
   bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of
   Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The
   Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which
   enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for
   fields in R(2) only use the square root of the time required by general
   algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional
   distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a
   parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak
   solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can,
   for some GFs in the Matern class, provide an explicit link, for any
   triangulation of R(d), between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis
   function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best
   from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the
   computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach
   generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including
   oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We
   illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a
   non-stationary model defined on a sphere.}},

Journal = {{TEST}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{417-451}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Spatio-temporal statistical models are increasingly being used across a
   wide variety of scientific disciplines to describe and predict
   spatially-explicit processes that evolve over time. Correspondingly, in
   recent years there has been a significant amount of research on new
   statistical methodology for such models. Although descriptive models
   that approach the problem from the second-order (covariance) perspective
   are important, and innovative work is being done in this regard, many
   real-world processes are dynamic, and it can be more efficient in some
   cases to characterize the associated spatio-temporal dependence by the
   use of dynamical models. The chief challenge with the specification of
   such dynamical models has been related to the curse of dimensionality.
   Even in fairly simple linear, first-order Markovian, Gaussian error
   settings, statistical models are often over parameterized. Hierarchical
   models have proven invaluable in their ability to deal to some extent
   with this issue by allowing dependency among groups of parameters. In
   addition, this framework has allowed for the specification of science
   based parameterizations (and associated prior distributions) in which
   classes of deterministic dynamical models (e.g., partial differential
   equations (PDEs), integro-difference equations (IDEs), matrix models,
   and agent-based models) are used to guide specific parameterizations.
   Most of the focus for the application of such models in statistics has
   been in the linear case. The problems mentioned above with linear
   dynamic models are compounded in the case of nonlinear models. In this
   sense, the need for coherent and sensible model parameterizations is not
   only helpful, it is essential. Here, we present an overview of a
   framework for incorporating scientific information to motivate dynamical
   spatio-temporal models. First, we illustrate the methodology with the
   linear case. We then develop a general nonlinear spatio-temporal
   framework that we call general quadratic nonlinearity and demonstrate
   that it accommodates many different classes of scientific-based
   parameterizations as special cases. The model is presented in a
   hierarchical Bayesian framework and is illustrated with examples from
   ecology and oceanography.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The initiation of environmental public health tracking
   systems in the United States and the United Kingdom provided an
   opportunity to advance techniques and tools available for spatial
   epidemiological analysis integrating both health and environmental data.
   OBJECTIVE: The Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) allows users to calculate
   adjusted and unadjusted standardized rates and risks. The RIF is
   embedded in ArcGIS so that further geographical information system (GIS)
   spatial functionality can be exploited or results can be exported to
   statistical packages for further tailored analyses where required. The
   RIF also links directly to several statistical packages and displays the
   results in the GIS.
   METHODS: The value of the RIF is illustrated here with two case studies:
   risk of leukemia in areas surrounding oil refineries in the State of
   Utah (USA) and an analysis of the geographical variation of risk of
   esophageal cancer in relation to zinc cadmium sulfide exposure in
   Norwich (United Kingdom).
   RESULTS: The risk analysis study in Utah did not suggest any evidence of
   increased relative risk of leukemia, multiple myeloma, or Hodgkin's
   lymphoma in the populations around the five oil-refining facilities but
   did reveal an excess risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that might warrant
   further investigation. The disease-mapping study in Norwich did not
   reveal any areas with higher relative risks of esophageal cancer common
   to both males and females, suggesting that a common geographically
   determined exposure was unlikely to be influencing cancer risk in the
   area.
   CONCLUSION: The RIF offers a tool that allows epidemiologists to quickly
   carry out ecological environmental epidemiological analysis such as risk
   assessment or disease mapping.}},

Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Campylobacteriosis is the leading cause of bacterial
   gastroenteritis in most developed countries. People are exposed to
   infection from contaminated food and environmental sources. However, the
   translation of these exposures into infection in the human population
   remains incompletely understood. This relationship is further
   complicated by differences in the presentation of cases, their
   investigation, identification, and reporting; thus, the actual
   differences in risk must be considered alongside the artefactual
   differences.
   Methods: Data on 33,967 confirmed Campylobacter infections in mainland
   Scotland between 2000 and 2006 (inclusive) that were spatially
   referenced to the postcode sector level were analysed. Risk factors
   including the Carstairs index of social deprivation, the easting and
   northing of the centroid of the postcode sector, measures of livestock
   density by species and population density were tested in univariate
   screening using a non-spatial generalised linear model. The NHS Health
   Board of the case was included as a random effect in this final model.
   Subsequently, a spatial generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) was
   constructed and age-stratified sensitivity analysis was conducted on
   this model.
   Results: The spatial GLMM included the protective effects of the
   Carstairs index (relative risk (RR) = 0.965, 95\% Confidence intervals
   (CIs) = 0.959, 0.971) and population density (RR = 0.945, 95\% CIs =
   0.916, 0.974. Following stratification by age group, population density
   had a significant protective effect (RR = 0.745, 95\% CIs = 0.700,
   0.792) for those under 15 but not for those aged 15 and older (RR =
   0.982, 95\% CIs = 0.951, 1.014). Once these predictors have been taken
   into account three NHS Health Boards remain at significantly greater
   risk (Grampian, Highland and Tayside) and two at significantly lower
   risk (Argyll and Ayrshire and Arran).
   Conclusions: The less deprived and children living in rural areas are at
   the greatest risk of being reported as a case of Campylobacter
   infection. However, this analysis cannot differentiate between actual
   risk and heterogeneities in individual reporting behaviour; nevertheless
   this paper has demonstrated that it is possible to explain the pattern
   of reported Campylobacter infections using both social and environmental
   predictors.}},

   previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs
   and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace
   approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples,
   carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in
   each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those
   requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model
   for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied
   degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now
   practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to
   likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with
   likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of
   clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less
   accurate for such data.}},

Abstract = {{Risk maps estimating the spatial distribution of infectious diseases are
   required to guide public health policy from local to global scales. The
   advent of model-based geostatistics (MBG) has allowed these maps to be
   generated in a formal statistical framework, providing robust metrics of
   map uncertainty that enhances their utility for decision-makers. In many
   settings, decision-makers require spatially aggregated measures over
   large regions such as the mean prevalence within a country or
   administrative region, or national populations living under different
   levels of risk. Existing MBG mapping approaches provide suitable metrics
   of local uncertainty-the fidelity of predictions at each mapped
   pixel-but have not been adapted for measuring uncertainty over large
   areas, due largely to a series of fundamental computational constraints.
   Here the authors present a new efficient approximating algorithm that
   can generate for the first time the necessary joint simulation of
   prevalence values across the very large prediction spaces needed for
   global scale mapping. This new approach is implemented in conjunction
   with an established model for P. falciparum allowing robust estimates of
   mean prevalence at any specified level of spatial aggregation. The model
   is used to provide estimates of national populations at risk under three
   policy-relevant prevalence thresholds, along with accompanying
   model-based measures of uncertainty. By overcoming previously
   unchallenged computational barriers, this study illustrates how MBG
   approaches, already at the forefront of infectious disease mapping, can
   be extended to provide large-scale aggregate measures appropriate for
   decision-makers.}},

However, also observed are some continuous covariates (e.g. maternal age) that exhibit pronounced non-linear relationships with the response variable. To account for such effects properly we merge kriging with additive models to obtain what we call geoadditive models. The merging becomes effortless by expressing both as linear mixed models. The resulting mixed model representation for the geoadditive model allows for fitting and diagnosis using standard methodology and software.},

     abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

It is also shown that the observation with maximum Mahalanobis distance from the sample mean must lie on the convex hull.

In addition, individual area-effects are incorporated as random effects to account for individual variation among regions. Finally, the model is extended by considering a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure for the random effects, these are the so called "Smooth-CAR" models, with the aim of separating the large-scale geographical trend, and local spatial correlation.

abstract = { P-splines are an attractive approach for modeling nonlinear smooth effects of covariates within the additive and varying coefficient models framework. In this article, we first develop a Bayesian version for P-splines and generalize in a second step the approach in various ways. First, the assumption of constant smoothing parameters can be replaced by allowing the smoothing parameters to be locally adaptive. This is particularly useful in situations with changing curvature of the underlying smooth function or with highly oscillating functions. In a second extension, one-dimensional P-splines are generalized to two-dimensional surface fitting for modeling interactions between metrical covariates. In a last step, the approach is extended to situations with spatially correlated responses allowing the estimation of geoadditive models. Inference is fully Bayesian and uses recent MCMC techniques for drawing random samples from the posterior. In a couple of simulation studies the performance of Bayesian P-splines is studied and compared to other approaches in the literature. We illustrate the approach by two complex application on rents for flats in Munich and on human brain mapping. }
